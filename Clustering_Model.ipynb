From this, we understand that cluster 2 may highlight an unusual pattern ( outlier)- the state was Arizona. The x-axis/ y-axis  values appear to be z scores ( they tell you how much above or below the mean a feature is for each cluster)- That being said, 0 means the feature is at the average, positive value means higher than average, and negative values mean lower than average.

        "Group commentary: Just by looking at the Kepler.gl map and PCA visualization, it's clear that there's a pattern of clustering ( we can see the seperation). Relating back to our area of intrest and purpose. Based on the cluster summary, we can make the connection that higher population ( states near high populated areas tend to have more diverse cases, but high in anonymity ( stranger homicides and unknown offenders). While States near low populated states (have higher social ties and leading to more solvable domestic crimes). We'd like to convey to police officiers/ state defenders are: Outlier state, deploy specialized task forces for gang violence, trafficking, or serial offense. Also defintly puch for more porensic transparency- we already saw that higher unsolved rates mean that the evidence may be week and forensic efforts may need more of investing. For cluster 3, in particular, since there are elevated rates of arson, children killed by babysitters, and stepfamily-related cases- we could advise to police officers to coordinate with cps and fire departments during invesitgations, and definetly have more training to recognize nuanced abuse in families. Also, request pscyhological assessments for defendants in domestic or child-involved homicides, especially where abuse cycles may be present. Additionally , for high solve rates ( domestic focused)- Leverage prior restraining orders or 911 call patterns to preempt escalation."
